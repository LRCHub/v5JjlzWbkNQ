[00:17.41] You could have given me a million reasons why
[00:23.09] But it wouldn't change a thing
[00:32.51] 'Cause you said it all when you said goodbye
[00:40.43] You took off your wedding ring
[00:55.43] 
[00:48.67] And I've been tryin' to get over you
[00:56.25] And I've been spending time alone
[01:04.12] I've been tryin' to get over you
[01:10.53] It'll take dying to get it done
[01:26.03] 
[01:20.08] All my friends keep trying to fix me up
[01:29.09] They say I need somebody new
[01:36.30] When it comes to love I've all but given up
[01:43.73] Cause life don't mean nothing, without you
[02:04.73] 
[01:51.16] I've been tryin' to get over you
[01:58.76] I've been spending time alone
[02:07.59] I've been tryin' to get over you
[02:15.82] It'll take dying to get it done
[02:31.32] 
[02:55.49] And I've been tryin' to get over you
[03:03.38] And I've been spending time alone
[03:11.16] I've been tryin' to get over you
[03:18.44] It'll take dying to get it done
[03:27.94] It'll take dying to get it done
