James Dean posters on their wall
(Five killed in a car-crash)
What a sad little end to it all
(Five killed in a car-crash)
Last seen having lots of fun
(Five dumped in a river)
Barefoot and on the run
(Five dumped in a river)

I am 'Mad from Scandinavia'
I want a guy in the London area
He must be crazy and Sagittarius
Cause I am Leo and I'm hilarious

Which gives me
Fun, fun, fun, Jeremy
Fun, fun, fun, Fifi
Fun, fun, fun, Jeremy
Fun, fun, fun

Last seen drinking daddy's own beer
(Five poisoned over dinner)
Singing Abba's Mamma Mia
(Five poisoned over dinner)
Drop dead watching Thunderbirds fly
(Five get over excited)
Poster on their wall says Why?
(Five get over excited)

I am a guy from Camden Town
My hair is curly but I gel it down
My clothes are black but my bread is brown
I'm really into early Motown

Which gives me
Fun, fun, fun, Jeremy
Fun, fun, fun, Fifi
Fun, fun, fun, Jeremy
Fun, fun, fun

Feigning concern, a Conservative pastime
Makes you feel doubtful right from the start
The expression she pulls is exactly like last time
You've got to conclude she just hasn't a heart

Fun, fun, fun, Jeremy
Fun, fun, fun, Fifi
Fun, fun, fun, Jeremy
Fun, fun, fun.
